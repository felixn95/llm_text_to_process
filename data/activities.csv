"A small company manufactures customized bicycles . Whenever the sales department receives an order , a new process instance is created . A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike . In the former case , the process instance is finished . In the latter case , the storehouse and the engineering department are informed . The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part . If the part is available in-house , it is reserved . If it is not available , it is back-ordered . This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list . In the meantime , the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle . If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished , the engineering department assembles the bicycle . Afterwards , the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance .","['receives an order', 'reject or accept the order', 'informed', 'processes the part list of the order', 'checks the required quantity of each part', 'reserved', 'back-ordered', 'prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle', 'assembles the bicycle', 'ships the bicycle to the customer', 'finishes the process instance']

"A customer brings in a defective computer and the CRS checks the defect and hands out a repair cost calculation back . If the customer decides that the costs are acceptable , the process continues , otherwise she takes her computer home unrepaired . The ongoing repair consists of two activities , which are executed , in an arbitrary order . The first activity is to check and repair the hardware , whereas the second activity checks and configures the software . After each of these activities , the proper system functionality is tested . If an error is detected another arbitrary repair activity is executed , otherwise the repair is finished .","['brings in', 'checks', 'hands out a repair cost calculation', 'decides', 'takes her computer home unrepaired', 'check and repair the hardware', 'checks and configures the software', 'tested', 'detected another arbitrary repair activity', 'is finished']"
"The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel . When a guest calls room service at The Evanstonian , the room-service manager takes down the order . She then submits an order ticket to the kitchen to begin preparing the food . She also gives an order to the sommelier ( i.e . , the wine waiter ) to fetch wine from the cellar and to prepare any other alcoholic beverages . Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage . Finally , she assigns the order to the waiter . While the kitchen and the sommelier are doing their tasks , the waiter readies a cart ( i.e . , puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware ) . The waiter is also responsible for nonalcoholic drinks . Once the food , wine , and cart are ready , the waiter delivers it to the guest ’ s room . After returning to the room-service station , the waiter debits the guest ’ s account . The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver .","['calls room service', 'takes down the order', 'submits an order ticket', 'gives an order', 'fetch wine', 'assigns the order', 'readies a cart', 'delivers it', 'debits the guest ’ s account', 'wait to do the billing']"
"Whenever a company makes the decision to go public , its first task is to select the underwriters . Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue . Usually they play a triple role : First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice , then they buy the issue , and finally they resell it to the public . Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly . Thus , in addition to handling the sale of a company ’ s issue , the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it . They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . In addition to registering the issue with the SEC , they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state . While the registration statement is awaiting approval , underwriters begin to firm up the issue price . They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors . Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC , underwriters fix the issue price . After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public , when they haven ’ t still found any reason not to do it .","['makes the decision to go public', 'select the underwriters', 'provide the company with procedural and financial advice', 'buy the issue', 'resell it to the public', 'give their seal of approval to it', 'prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)', 'check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state', 'firm up the issue price', 'talk to potential investors', 'fix the issue price', 'enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public']"

"The process is initiated by a switch-over request . In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company . Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution . The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system . After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility . In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list . The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times . In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow . This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge . The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) . In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation . In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved . Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again . In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed . A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS . It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future . The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment . In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict . The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) . If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract . The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it . Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) . An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues . The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process . On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report . At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier . Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer . For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then . After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information . The process of winning a new customer ends here .","[

"The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute . This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment . The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient . On the basis of this information , the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in . The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental , health , and social state of the patient in question . This information is recorded on a registration form . At the end of the conversation , this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute . Here , the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed . For new patients , a patient file is created . The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file . Patient files are kept at the secretarial office and may not leave the building . At the secretarial office , two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient . The registration card contains a set of basic patient data . The new patient is added on the list of new notices . Halfway the week , at Wednesday , a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place . The medical team consists of social-medical workers , physicians , and a psychiatrist . At this meeting , the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team . Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker , who will act as the first intaker of the patient . One of the physicians will act as the second intaker . In assigning intakers , the teamleader takes into account their expertise , the region they are responsible for , earlier contacts they might have had with the patient , and their case load . The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office . For each new assignment , it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required . This information is added to the assignment list . The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system . It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient . An intaker keeps this registration with him at times when visiting the patient and in his close proximity when he is at the office . For each patient for which the medical file is required , the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient , requesting for a copy of the medical file . As soon as this copy is received , the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file . The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible . During the first meeting , the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out . Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook . After a visit , the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient . The standard checklist is also added to the patient's file . The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician if required has been received . Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients . The secretarial office types out these tapes , after which the information is added to the patient file . As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place , the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status . For the staff meeting on Wednesday , they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients . For each of these patients , the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan .

"An employee purchases a product or service he requires . For instance , a sales person on a trip rents a car . The employee submits an expense report with a list of items , along with the receipts for each item . A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report . Since the company has expense rules , there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection . These rules could be automated , to reduce the workload on the supervisor . If the supervisor rejects the report , the employee , who submitted it , is given a chance to edit it , for example to correct errors or better describe an expense . If the supervisor approves the report , it goes to the treasurer . The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list . If all is in order , the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing ( including , e.g . , payment or refund , and accounting ) . If receipts are missing or do not match the report , he sends it back to the employee . If a report returns to the employee for corrections , it must again go to a supervisor , even if the supervisor previously approved the report . If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing , the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system . The process waits for the payment confirmation .

"Every time we get a new order from the sales department , first , one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date . Once that information is present , it has to be entered into our production planning system ( PPS ) . It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized . Besides , it creates a list of parts to be procured . Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system ( ERP ) , so the data must be transferred manually . By the way , that is the second step . Once all the data is present , we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary . Once production is scheduled to start , we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation .

Sometimes , we buy details for cold calls , sometimes , our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes , you just happen to know somebody , who is interested in the product . Then we start calling the customer . That is done by the call center staff . They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project . Of course , asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important . If this is not the case , we leave him alone , except if the potential project budget is huge . Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer . If the customer is interested in the end , the next step is a detailed online presentation . It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation . Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us . If we are not contacted within 2 weeks , a sales representative is calling the customer .
