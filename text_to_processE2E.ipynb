Nodes of type Task (=Activities) have exactly one successor node and exactly one predecessor node. Tasks can be followed by gateways (XOR-Split or XOR-Join) or by other tasks. Nodes of type XOR-Split have one predecessor node and two successor nodes (successor_true, successor_false) and a boolean condition. Nodes of type XOR-Join have two predecessor nodes (predecessor_true, predecessor_false) and one successor node.
