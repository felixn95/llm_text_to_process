Assume the following for the definition of Workflow Models: A Workflow Model consists of the following node types: Task, XOR-Split, XOR-Join, Start-Node, End-Node. Each node of type Task has a label. Nodes of type Start-Node have exactly one successor node and no predecessor node. Nodes of type End-Node have exactly one predecessor node and no successor node. Nodes of type Task have exactly one successor node and exactly one predecessor node. Nodes of type XOR-Split have one predecessor node and two successor nodes (successor_true, successor_false) and a boolean condition. The successor_true is executed if the condition is true, and the successor_false is executed if the condition is false. Nodes of type XOR-Join have two predecessor nodes (predecessor_true, predecessor_false) and one successor node. The successor gets active after one predecessor is executed. All node types except for start-node and end-node are optional. If a process contains a xor-split node, it must also contain a xor-join node. Please never forget to close a xor-split with a xor-join.

Here is an example: 
The MPON sends the dismissal to the MPOO. The MPOO reviews the dismissal. The MPOO opposes the dismissal of MPON or the MPOO confirmes the dismissal of the MPON.

{ "Activities": [
{"id": "T1", "label": "sends the dismissal"},
{"id": "T2", "label": "reviews dismissal"},
{"id": "T3", "label": "opposes the dismissal"},
{"id": "T4", "label": "confirms the dismissal"}
]}
{
  "WorkflowModel": {
    "start-Node": {
      "id": "S1"
    },
    "end-node": {
      "id": "E1"
    },
    "tasks": [
      {
        "id": "T1",
        "label": "sends the dismissal",
        "successor": "XS1",
        "predecessor": "S1"
      },
      {
        "id": "T2",
        "label": "reviews dismissal",
        "successor": "XS1",
        "predecessor": "T1"
      },
      {
        "id": "T3",
        "label": "opposes the dismissal",
        "successor": "XJ1",
        "predecessor": "XS1"
      },
      {
        "id": "T4",
        "label": "confirms the dismissal",
        "successor": "XJ1",
        "predecessor": "XS1"
      }
    ],
    "gateways": [
      {
        "type": "XOR-Split",
        "id": "XS1",
        "condition": "opposed or confirmed?",
        "successor_true": "XJ1",
        "successor_false": "E1",
        "predecessor": "T2"
      },
      {
        "type": "XOR-Join",
        "id": "XJ1",
        "predecessor_true": "T3",
        "predecessor_false": "T4",
        "successor": "E1"
      }
    ]
  }
}

Use the below listed process and its activities to create a workflow model for the scenario:
A Customer places an order. Then the Warehouse checks the payment of the order. If the payment is successful, the warehouse ships the order. Otherwise the warehouse rejects the order.

{ "Activities": [
{"id": "T1", "label": "places an order"},
{"id": "T2", "label": "checks for payment"},
{"id": "T3", "label": "ships the order"},
{"id": "T4", "label": "rejects the order"}
]}
